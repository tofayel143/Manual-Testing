## Introduction

Manual testing is a crucial process in software quality assurance. It involves executing test cases, verifying functionality, and ensuring the software behaves as expected. This README outlines the steps to perform effective manual testing.

## Prerequisites

Before starting manual testing, ensure you have the following:

- Access to the software or application under test.
- A clear understanding of the requirements and user stories.
- Test data and any necessary credentials.
- Test documentation, including test cases and test plan.

## Testing Environment Setup

 - **Installation**: Ensure that the software or application is correctly installed on the testing environment.

 - **Configuration**: Set up the application with the necessary configurations and settings as specified in the test plan.

 - **Test Data**: Prepare the required test data, including valid and invalid inputs, user accounts, and any other relevant information.

## Test Plan

Refer to the test plan document to understand the scope, objectives, and goals of the testing process. The test plan provides a roadmap for your testing activities.

## Report

- **Defect Identification**: If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior during testing, document them with detailed information.

- **Severity and Priority**: Assign a severity and priority level to each defect based on its impact and urgency.

- **Defect Tracking**: Use a defect tracking system to log and manage defects. Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and screenshots if necessary.
